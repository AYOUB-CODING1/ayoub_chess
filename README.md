## Description

Ayoub Chess is a desktop-based chess game developed in Python using the Pygame library. This project was created as the final submission for Harvard’s CS50x 2025 course. The goal of the project was to build a fully functional and interactive chess game that supports two human players playing on the same machine.

The game features a custom graphical user interface (GUI), legal move validation, visual indicators for valid moves (dots), sound effects for piece movement, and an audio alert when the king is in check. It is also packaged as a standalone .exe file for easy distribution and use without needing to install Python or dependencies.
